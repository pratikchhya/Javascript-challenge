# Aliens are Real!!

Created a dynamic table based upon a dataset that was provided. Filter was created to the table data for specific values. 

## Technology used:

- JavaScript,
- HTML
- CSS
- D3.js

## Level 1:

- Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects that appends table to web page and then adds new rows of data for       each UFO sighting. Table have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.
- Date form was used in HTML document and JavaScript was used that would listen for events and search through the date/time column to find   rows that match user input.
