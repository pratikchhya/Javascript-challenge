##Aliens are Real!!
Created a dynamic table based upon a dataset that was provided. Filter was created to the table data for specific values. 

##Technology used:
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js

##Level 1:
- Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects that appends table to web page and then adds new rows of data for       each UFO sighting. Table have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.
- Date form was used in HTML document and JavaScript was used that would listen for events and search through the date/time column to find   rows that match user input.

##Level 2:

- multiple input tags and dropdown was created, so that user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following       criteria based on the table columns:
  i.	date/time
  ii.	city
  iii.	state
  iv.	country
  v.	shape
